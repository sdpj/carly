<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: Is this service really free?</span>
<br><br>A: Yes, completely free.  No strings.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How can I share my videos and link to them from my website?</span>
<br><br>A: Simply copy the watch URL and put them on your site, as easy as that. We are adding embed capabilities soon, do not worry.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What kind of videos can I upload?</span>
<br><br>A: You may upload any kind of personal video that you'd like to share with the world. We don't allow any nudity and your video must be appropriate for all audiences.
				<br>
				<br>
				However, this still leaves a lot of room for creativity!! Do you own a <a href="results.php?search=dog">dog</a> or a <a href="results.php?search=cat">cat</a>? Have you gone on vacationing in <a href="results.php?search=mexico">Mexico</a>? Do you live in <a href="results.php?search=netherlands">The Netherlands</a>?
				<br>
				<br>
				These are just some examples of the videos that our users are uploading. In the end, you know yourself best. What would <i>you</i> like to capture on video?
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How long can my video be?</span>
<br><br>A: There is no time limit on your video, but the video file you upload must be less than 50 MB in size. If your video is too large for FrameBit, use a free service such as <a href="https://8mb.video">8mb.video</a>
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What video file formats can I upload?</span>
<br><br>A: FrameBit accepts video files from most digital cameras and from cell phones in the .AVI, .MOV, and .MPG file formats.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How can I improve my videos?</span>
<br><br>A: We encourage you to edit your videos with software such as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051102071344/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/default.mspx" target="_blank">Windows MovieMaker</a> (included with every Windows installation), or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051102071344/http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/" target="_blank">Apple iMovie</a>. Using these programs you can easily edit your videos, add soundtracks, etc.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What is your policy on copyright infringement?</span>
<br><br>A: FrameBit respects the rights of copyright holders and publishers and is only accepting video uploads from persons who hold all necessary rights to the uploaded material. Our policy is to respond to any notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If we receive a notice or otherwise have reason to believe that content you submitted infringes another party's copyright, your account may be terminated and the video removed from FrameBit.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: It keeps asking me to log in, what should I do?</span>
<br><br>A: Make sure you have cookies enabled.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What are 'tags'?</span>
<br><br>A: Tags are basically keywords that describe your videos.  Like, if you have a surfing video, you might choose to tag it with 'surfing,' 'water' and 'waves.'  Other users that enjoy watching surfing videos can then search for 'surfing' and your video will pop up in their search results.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How do I download videos?</span>
<br><br>A: While we do not support downloading, you can save videos in your favorites folder for future viewing.  Simply click the 'add to favorites' button that is shown below a video when its playing.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How do I remove a video?</span>
<br><br>A: To remove one of your videos, simply go to "My Videos". Click on the 'remove video' button next to the video you'd like to remove.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: Is there a limit to how much I can upload?</span>
<br><br>A: The only limit is 100MB per video.  We don't have any limit for the number of videos you upload, and we don't foresee adding a ceiling anytime in the future.  So, get crankin' and upload as many videos as you'd like - its more content for the FrameBit community to enjoy!
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: How do I embed videos on my MySpace/Friendster profile?!?</span>
<br><br>A: Please see sharing.php for information on how to embed your videos on Friendster/MySpace/eBay/blogs.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: Videos won't play, what's wrong?</span>
<br><br>A: Please make sure you have the latest version of your browser that supports HTML5. To fix this, upgrade your browser on it's respective download page.

				<span class="highlight">Q: How do I report copyright infringement?</span>
<br><br>A: If you believe that someone else has uploaded your copyrighted content without your permission, we encourage you to contact that person in order to resolve any differences with them directly.  You can also contact our support team using this <a href="contact.php">form</a> for instructions on how to submit a copyright infringement notice to FrameBit.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What if I have been falsely accused of copyright infringement?</span>
<br><br>A: We'll let you know if we receive a copyright complaint about any of your video content that is hosted on FrameBit. We'll give you the opportunity to respond appropriately.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What are you doing to prevent content that violates your policies from appearing in FrameBit?</span>
<br><br>A: We do a preliminary review on uploaded videos through both a manual and automated process. Although we try our best to detect and remove videos that violate our policy guidelines, our review process is primarily focused on removing adult content or obvious copyright violations, and is not bulletproof. However, we encourage our viewers to notify us when they discover policy violations or copyright issues -- we have a process for reviewing reported policy violations, and respond to reported copyright violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
<br><br><span class="highlight">Q: What is this .MSWMM file? How do I create a movie with Windows Movie Maker?</span>
<br><br>A: A .MSWMM file is a Windows Movie Maker Project file. By saving the project, it allows you to return to the movide and make modifications at a later time. However, if you're satisfied with the movie and would like to upload and share the result through FrameBit, you will need to choose the "Save Movie File" option under the "File" menu (which is different from "Save Project" that creates the .MSWMM file).

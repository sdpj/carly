  <br />
  <font style='font-size:12px;'>
  All the items you upload are your property. If another user copies your item, please report it to us immediately at items@social-paradise.net and we will take care of it. On the other hand, if you copy another item without authorized permission, we will take punishments very hard. Your account will be frozen in a range from 7 days to termination. If you had sufficient permission to re-upload a similar item from the ORIGINAL item with proof, please send us an email at appeals@social-paradise.net to have your ban appealed. We will need a screenshot of the way your other party has interacted, it has to be on SP, we can not track other conversations on 3rd party sites.<br /><b><background color='red'>Uploading an item from another site that is not yours or you made is strictly forbidden.</font></b>

  <br />
  <font style='font-size:12px;'>
  <b>Alt Spamming</b> is a major issue in Social-Paradise, which is why you are only permitted to have two accounts on Social-Paradise. If you have more than 2 then your all your accounts will be terminated. You may make a new account after your accounts are terminated, but if you repeat the same offence one more time, you will be terminated again and IP banned permanently.

		<h2>About Avatar-Universe</h2>
		<p>
			Avatar-Universe Incorporated (&quot;Avatar-Universe&quot;) is an online virtual website where users can interact on several levels. Your privacy is important to us; this is why we created this Privacy Policy so that you are aware of what information is collected, how we use it, and who we share it with.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our offices can be found by emailing us at <a href='mailto:info@avatar-gamer.ga'>info@avatar-gamer.ga</a>. We keep our billing location private for security reasons. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This privacy policy covers official programs listed from Avatar-Universe Inc. aswell as our main website (and mobile website, if we ever develop one).
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Avatar-Universe works like this...</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<li>
				A player registers an online account which is then places into our database for everyone to see.
			</li>
			<li>
				Users can interact via chat, forum boards, javagames, and official programs released from Avatar-Universe Inc. via the website.
			</li>
			<li>
				Every user is given the ability to upload items to our user-store and 100 BUX on sign-up.
			</li>
			<li>
				Users can earn BUX by buying and selling items in our store, or user-store, aswell as admin-generated contests and things of the sort.
			</li>
			<li>
				Users can purchase our premium membership services, which gives them more benefits than being just a regular user.
			</li>
		</p>
		<h2>Requested Information</h2>
		<p>
			Users wishing to save statistics, share items, and otherwise participate in the economy are required to enter a username and password. We advise users to create a username that does not reflect their own name nor reveal personally identifiable information. We also advise users to pick a password that is not easy to guess, and to not share that password. For security reasons, we store passwords in encrypted form.
		</p>
		<p>
			Usernames are used for participating in site features and are not used to identify individual users outside of their activities on our site. Usernames are not passed along to 3rd parties except in the case where a purchase is made to be credited to the account. In this case our purchasing vendor is given the account name in order to credit the account when the transaction is completed.
		</p>
		<p>
			All users are asked for, but are not required to give, a <i>valid</i> email address on sign-up. This can be updated or changed at any time by going to your account settings.
		</p>
		<p>
			All text on the site is filtered pro-actively to remove references to addresses, emails, phone numbers, age, and other personally identifiable information regardless of security and privacy settings. All text is also filtered for profanity, phishing, and adult or suggestive content. Our system is a combination of human and automated processes; like all filtering technology, our processes are not 100% effective.
		</p>
		<p>
			Users wishing to purchase a premium membership or BUX are required to enter billing information, including name, billing address, credit card or PayPal number, and billing email. For children under 13, we request the parent's billing information. Billing information is retained to support customer service inquiries, but we do not retain the full credit card number. Remember <b>NEVER</b> to use a credit card without permission from the card holder.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you (or your child) choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site; Avatar-Universe does not store this information.
		</p>
		<h2>Collected Information</h2>
		<p>
			Avatar-Universe uses a software technology called &quot;cookies.&quot; Cookies are small text files that we place in our visitor's computer browsers to store their preferences. These cookies do not store personally identifiable information. For account security purposes, we may store a cookie that contains the encrypted user password; the original password cannot be recovered by hackers. Users who disable cookies in their browsers may not be able to login to the Avatar-Universe website or participate in website activities. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We also use cookies and clear gifs (on-page tracking code) to track user entry onto and movement within our website. This helps us credit advertisers appropriately, and measure the health and effectiveness of our website. For example, we use tracking to determine if new page designs are user friendly or too complicated. Our tracking approach is industry standard, and includes non-personally identifiable information such as IP address, browser type, and date/time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, when visitors come to our site, we automatically collect some non-personally identifiable computer information, such as the type of computer operating system (e.g., Windows 95 or Mac OS), the web browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) being used, IP address, and information regarding the Internet service provider. This information is used to provide technical and community support.
		</p>
		<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
		<p>
			We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
		</p>
		<p>
			We pass user billing information on to our transaction processing partners. This is done for non-anonymous payment types, including credit card, Pay by Phone, and PayPal payments. For recurring monthly transactions, PayPal retains the credit card authorization on file, but we do not.
		</p>
		<p>
			We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
		</p>
		<p>
			To the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personally identifiable information in response to a law enforcement agencies or other public agencies (including schools or children services) request or if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our website, protect the security or integrity of our website, or enable us to take precautions against liability.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will not use or transfer personally identifiable information in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing parental notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.
		</p>
		<p>
			Parents have the right to consent to the site’s use of their child’s personal information without having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties as we do not share children’s information with third parties.
